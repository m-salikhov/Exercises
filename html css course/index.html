        >Page load time</a
      >
      is the average time it takes for a page to appear on your screen. It is
      calculated from when the page link is clicked or loaded to when it is
      completed. In enterprise applications, reducing the amount of time it
      takes for a page to load is an important investment, as we have seen in
      examples of how it could minimize conversion rate and affect business
      revenue.

    <h3>Why Reduce Page Load Time in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>
      As we have discussed above, there are financial and other implications,
      such as a drop in traffic, drop in conversions, or increased bounce rate,
      etc., for not reducing the page load time. Below are some benefits why you
      should reduce the page load time of your software application.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Improve user experience:</strong>
        Faster page loading times lead to improved user experience, as users can
        find the information they need quickly and easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Increase conversion rates:</strong>
        When users can load a page quickly, they are more likely to stay on the
        page and complete the desired action.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Improve SEO rankings:</strong>
        From Search Engine Journals, search engine algorithms take page loading
        times into account when ranking websites, so faster page loading times
        can help improve SEO rankings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reduce server load:</strong>

        Faster page loading times can reduce the load on the server, leading to
        improved performance and reliability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reduce bounce rates:</strong>
        Faster page loading times can reduce bounce rates, as users are more
        likely to stay.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When a website takes a long time to load, users may be quick to abandon it
      and switch to a faster-performing one. On the other hand, a website with a
      fast loading speed will give the impression of being user-friendly and
      appealing, thus increasing the potential for more website traffic.
